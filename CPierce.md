# Charles Pierce


## About Me
My name is Charles, I am currently a junior at UNCG. I have 2 cats, I play the guitar, and I've always enjoyed playing fps games.


## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to get some valuable experience actually collaborating with someone else on a project, so that I may feel more comfortable working with others outside of just a classroom environment.
